CamOdoCal
=========
 
Introduction
------------

This C++ library supports the following tasks:

1. Intrinsic calibration of a generic camera.
2. Extrinsic self-calibration of a multi-camera rig for which odometry data is provided.
3. Extrinsic infrastructure-based calibration of a multi-camera rig for which a map generated from task 2 is provided.


The intrinsic calibration process computes the parameters for one of the following three camera models:
* Pinhole camera model
* Unified projection model (C. Mei, and P. Rives, Single View Point Omnidirectional Camera Calibration from Planar Grids, ICRA 2007)
* Equidistant fish-eye model (J. Kannala, and S. Brandt, A Generic Camera Model and Calibration Method for Conventional, Wide-Angle, and Fish-Eye Lenses, PAMI 2006)

By default, the unified projection model is used since this model approximates a wide range of cameras from normal cameras to catadioptric cameras. Note that in our equidistant fish-eye model, we use 8 parameters: k2, k3, k4, k5, mu, mv, u0, v0. k1 is set to 1.

Typically for a set of 4 cameras with 500 frames each, the extrinsic self-calibration takes 2 hours. In contrast, the extrinsic infrastructure-based calibration runs in near real-time, and is strongly recommended if you are calibrating multiple rigs in the same area.

Build Instructions for Ubuntu
-----------------------------

*Required dependencies*
* BLAS (Ubuntu package: libblas-dev)
* Boost >= 1.4.0 (Ubuntu package: libboost-all-dev)
* CUDA >= 4.2
* Eigen3 (Ubuntu package: libeigen3-dev)
* glog
* OpenCV >= 2.4.6
* SuiteSparse >= 4.2.1

*Optional dependencies*
* GTest
* OpenMP

1. Before you compile the repository code, you need to install the required
   dependencies, and install the optional dependencies if required.
   Download the SuiteSparse libraries from this [link] [1] and
   do not use the Ubuntu package since the SuiteSparseQR library is
   missing in the Ubuntu package and is required for covariance evaluation.

2. Build the code.

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

3. If you wish to generate Eclipse project files, run:

        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ..

Examples
--------

Go to the build folder where the executables corresponding to the examples are located in. To see all allowed options for each executable, use the --help option which shows a description of all available options.

1. Intrinsic calibration ([src/examples/intrinsic_calib.cc] [2])

        bin/intrinsic_calib -i ../data/images/ -p img --camera-model mei

   The camera-model parameter takes one of the following three values: pinhole, mei, and kannala-brandt.

2. Stereo calibration  ([src/examples/stereo_calib.cc] [3])

        bin/stereo_calib -i ../data/images/ --prefix-l left --prefix-r right --camera-model mei

   The camera-model parameter takes one of the following three values: pinhole, mei, and kannala-brandt.

3. Extrinsic calibration ([src/examples/extrinsic_calib.cc] [4])

   Note 1: Extrinsic calibration requires the use of a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary data
           corresponding to 64-bit SURF descriptors can be found in data/vocabulary/surf64.yml.gz.
           This file has to be located in the directory from which you run the executable.
           
   Note 2: If you wish to use the chessboard data in the final bundle adjustment step to ensure
           that lines are straight in rectified pinhole images, please copy all [camera\_name]\_chessboard_data.dat
           files generated by the intrinsic calibration to the working data folder. The extrinsic calibration
           will locate these files, and if these files are present, use the chessboard data stored in these files
           in the final bundle adjustment.

4. Infrastructure-based calibration

   Details to be released soon!
